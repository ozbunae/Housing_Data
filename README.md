# Phase 2 Project

## Project Description
For this project I used housing data from King County Washington which is the Seattle area. 
Moving on from basic EDA, this project centers around using linear regression and ordinary least squares methods to predict the price of housing data.  

### 1.1 The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. 

This project also utilized data that was parsed fromt the Airbnb website to Kaggle.  This information told us things like ratings, rental types, average nightly, monthly, and weekly cost, ext.  Although it weakened our model when we put it in it gave us a good idea of what the parameters were for the house type we were looking for.

### 1.2 Data Cleaning

As with all data we spent a lot of time cleaning the data.   The data really needed to be investigated by renovated v. non renovated.  The problem with this is that it divided up the data in a way that once it was cleaned created two very weak models.  Some useful information was retrieved from both of these scenarios but ultimately, a model with the data from both renovated v. non renovated homes was used.  

Histograms were used as a frequent technique through the cleaning process to see how normally distributed the continuous data was. The categorical data was binned and split into dummies in order to prevent it from messing with the final model.

For the main model with all of the original data, a z score multiplier was used to eliminate outliers.  Because it was such an agressive technique there was no need to go through the data column by column.  In the data sets separated by renovated v. nonrenovated, an interquartile method as well as individual column cleaning was applied in order to keep the smaller data frames in tact. 

### 1.3 Business Problem

The business problem is two young investors who want to invest in some homes to flip into Airbnbs.  Dave is a contracter and will do all of the work himself in order to elminate some overhead cost.  They want to know three things before they move forward with their descision:

1. Is it even worth it to renovate?  Is it possible to just find a home that is already renovated or in better condition to turn into an Airbnb?
2. If it is worth it, what areas should we be looking at?  Is there an opportunity to purchase a non renovated home next to an area that is already renovated?
3. What size home should you be buying?



## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis was used to come up with some inital visualizations and answer preliminary questions in the process.

### 2.1 Question 1:
We found that yes, it is definitely worth it to invest in a non renovated home if you are doing the renovations yourself.  
Investigating popular neighborhoods surrounding the already renovated areas to take advantage of prime real estate.  The mean cost of a grade 6 home from the renovated group of homes is on average $100,000 more than the average cost of a grade 6 non â€“ renovated home.  This means that it seems to be significantly cheaper to purchase a property that has not been renovated and purchase materials to customize it.

### 2.2 Question 2:
Condition v. Grade of a Home.  This was a case where the question arose out of a graph that was created.

### 2.3 Question 3:
How do neighborhoods effect price.

## Regression Modeling

### 3.1 Problems
A model was built out using soley the KC data set.  Separating out the data into renovated and non renovated data and then building 2 seperate models resulted in an exceptionally low R2 and high p values. Adding in the Airbnb data set to the KC data set resulted in the same problem.

### 3.2 Solution
A final regression model was built using only the KC data set.  As an agressive approach to outliers, the z score method was used in the coding, this did knock our yr_renovated feature and the waterfront feature.  More analysis is done on renovated v. non renovated homes in two separate jupyter notebooks.  After outliers removed, the data was listed by categorical and continuous variables.  Histograms were used to check for a normal distribution in continuous columns.  Bins were created for 3 of the categorical columns and then all categorical columns were ran with dummy variables.  

### 3.3 Checks and Balances
Multiple methods were used to check assumptions. 

This includes:

Variance inflation factor
Breusch Pagan
QQ plot
Test and Train
Dropping one column from each set of dummies to keep our model in check
Doing a log transformation on Price
